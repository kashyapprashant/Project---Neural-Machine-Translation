# Project---Neural-Machine-Translation

1. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is the task of using **Artificial Neural Network** models for translation from one language to other.

2. The NMT model generally consists of an **encoder** that encodes a source sentence into a xed-length vector from which
a **decoder** generates a translation.

3. This problem can be thought as a prediction problem, where given a sequence of words in source language as input,
task is to predict the output sequence of words in target language.

4. The dataset comes from **http://www.manythings.org/anki/**, where you may nd tab delimited bilingual sentence pairs in
different les based on the source and target language of your choice.

5. For this project, you need to use **French - English** language pairs.
